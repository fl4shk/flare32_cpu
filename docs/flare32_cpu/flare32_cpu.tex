	\setcounter{section}{-1}
	%This is an instruction set designed to be similar to the SuperFX/GSU,
	%while not being binary compatible, nor even assembly language
	%compatible.  It takes some of the ideas from the GSU and runs with
	%them.
	This is an instruction set that is basically just my answer to THUMB
	(especially original THUMB), with some ideas taken from other places as
	well.  This shows how to get more out of 16-bit instructions than THUMB
	allows.

	\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Registers}
	There are sixteen general-purpose registers:  \texttt{r0}, \texttt{r1},
	\texttt{r2}, \texttt{...}, \texttt{r11}, \texttt{rtemp}, \texttt{lr},
	\texttt{fp}, \texttt{sp}.  From the hardware's perspective, they are
	all equivalent, except for \texttt{sp}, which is also used for the
	address of \texttt{push} and \texttt{pop} instructions.  Each register
	is 32 bits long.  For special purpose registers, there are also
	\texttt{pc}, the program counter (which is 32 bits long), and the
	\texttt{flags}.  Also there are the interrupts-related registers:
	\texttt{ids} (the destination to go to upon an interrupt happening),
	\texttt{ira} (the program counter value to return to after an
	interrupt) and \texttt{ie} (whether or not interrupts are enabled).
	Two more registers are \texttt{hi} and \texttt{lo}, which are used as
	the high 32 bits and low 32 bits of the result of a 32 by 32 -> 64
	multiplication, or as the high 32 bits and low 32 bits of the result of
	a 64 by 32 -> 64 division.  Here are the flags:

	\section{Instruction Set}
	While this machine takes inspiration from the GSU, it uses 16-bit
	instructions rather than 8-bit ones.

	\subsection{Instruction Group 0:  The \texttt{pre} Instruction}
	The following encoding is used, with each character representing one
	bit:  \\
	\texttt{000i iiii iiii iiii}, where 
	
	\singlespacing
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{i} is a 13-bit constant.
	\end{itemize}

	At the assembly language level, the instruction is simply
	\texttt{pre expr}, but it isn't typical to use this instruction
	directly in assembly language source code.  Instead, when an immediate
	value will not fit in a 5-bit signed immediate, this instruction will
	be inserted by the assembler right before the instruction using an
	immediate value.  The 13-bit constant will be used as bits
	\texttt{[17:5]} of the immediate value of the following instruction.
	The full 18-bit immediate value will then be sign extended to 32 bits.
	Also, if the previous instruction was a \texttt{pre}, interrupts will
	not be serviced.

	\subsection{Instruction Group 1:  ALU Instr with Immediate}
	The following encoding is used, with each character representing one
	bit:  \\
	\texttt{001i iiii aaaa oooo}, where

	\singlespacing
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{i} is a 5-bit sign-extended immediate
		\item \texttt{a} encodes register \texttt{rA}
		\item \texttt{o} is the opcode
		%\item \texttt{f} is \texttt{0} if this instruction cannot affect
		%flags and \texttt{1} if this instruction is permitted to affect
		%flags. 
	\end{itemize}
	\doublespacing

	%At the assembly language level, \texttt{pick} is simply

	%when an instruction is typed as \texttt{instr rA, rB, operand}
	%\textit{and} when \texttt{rA} is not the same register as \texttt{rB},
	%a \texttt{pick rB} instruction will be inserted by the assembler before
	%the instruction in the source code.  As mentioned before, when the
	%instruction previous to the current one is either a \texttt{pre} or a
	%\texttt{pick}, interrupts will not be serviced.  Note that since
	%\texttt{pre}'s 13-bit partial immediate only affects the instruction
	%following the \texttt{pre}, only a 5-bit signed immediate can be used
	%with \texttt{pick} and an instruction from group 1.  For all

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{o} is the opcode
		\item \texttt{i} is a 9-bit sign-extended immediate, which can
		still be affected by \texttt{pre}, but when \texttt{pre} is the
		instruction before this one, only bits \texttt{[4:0]} of the
		immediate value encoded into this instruction will be used by the
		hardware, with the remaining bits of the immediate coming from
