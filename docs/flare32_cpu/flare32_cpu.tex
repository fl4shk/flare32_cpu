	%%This is an instruction set designed to be similar to the SuperFX/GSU,

	%%them.
	%This is an instruction set that is basically just my answer to THUMB
	%(especially original THUMB), with some ideas taken from other places as
	%well.  This shows how to get more out of 16-bit instructions than THUMB

	\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Registers}
	There are sixteen general-purpose registers:  \texttt{r0}, \texttt{r1},
	\texttt{r2}, \texttt{...}, \texttt{r11}, \texttt{r12}, \texttt{lr},
	\texttt{fp}, \texttt{sp}.  Each register
	is 32 bits long.  For special purpose registers, there are also
	\texttt{pc}, the program counter (which is 32 bits long), and the
	\texttt{flags}.  Also there are the interrupts-related registers:
	\texttt{ids} (the destination to go to upon an interrupt happening),
	\texttt{ira} (the program counter value to return to after an
	interrupt) and \texttt{ie} (whether or not interrupts are enabled).
	Two more registers are \texttt{hi} and \texttt{lo}, which are used as
	the high 32 bits and low 32 bits of the result of a 32 by 32 -> 64
	multiplication, or as the high 32 bits and low 32 bits of the result of
	a 64 by 64 -> 64 division.  Here are the flags:

	\section{Instruction Set}
	%While this machine takes inspiration from the GSU, it uses 16-bit
	%instructions rather than 8-bit ones.

	\subsection{Instruction Group 0:  \texttt{pre} and \texttt{lpre}}
	For \texttt{pre}, the following encoding is used, with each character
	representing one bit:  \\
	\texttt{0000 iiii iiii iiii}, where 
	
	\singlespacing
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{i} is a 12-bit constant.
	\end{itemize}

	For \texttt{lpre}, the following encoding is used, with each character
	representing one bit:  \\
	\texttt{0001 0iii iiii iiii  iiii iiii iiii iiii}, where

	\singlespacing
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{i} is a 27-bit constant.
	\end{itemize}

	\texttt{pre} and \texttt{lpre} are mechanisms by which immediates
	larger than normal can be used, essentially acting like variable width
	instructions.

	There is no mechanism in the assembly language itself to use
	\texttt{pre} or \texttt{lpre} as instructions.  Instead, it is expected
	that the assembler or linker will be the one to insert \texttt{pre} or
	\texttt{lpre} as needed if an immediate is too large for a particular
	instruction.  

	
	If \texttt{pre} is used, the immediate field of the
	\texttt{pre} instruction will form bits \texttt{[16:5]} of the
	immediate of the next non-\texttt{index} instruction.  The 17-bit
	immediate will then be sign-extended to 32 bits.

	On the other hand, if \texttt{lpre} is used, the immediate field of the
	\texttt{lpre} instruction will form bits \texttt{[31:5]} of the
	immediate of the next non-\texttt{index} instruction.

	Instructions that use an immediate value, other than \texttt{pre},
	\texttt{lpre}, and relative branches normally have 5-bit immediates.
	Relative branches normally have 9-bit branch offsets.  if \texttt{pre}
	or \texttt{lpre} is used with a relative branch, bits \texttt{[9:5]} of
	the branch offset that is encoded directly into a relative branch
	instruction will be ignored, and the immediate field of the
	\texttt{pre} or \texttt{lpre} instruction will be used to determine
	bits \texttt{[9:5]} of the branch offset..

	\subsubsection{Handling of \texttt{pre}, \texttt{lpre}, and
	\texttt{index}}

	When a \texttt{pre} or \texttt{lpre} instruction is found, \texttt{pre}
	or \texttt{lpre} will be considered to be "in effect".  This condition
	lasts for one or two instructions after the \texttt{pre} or
	\texttt{lpre} instruction, depending on whether or not \texttt{index}
	was in effect.

	\texttt{index} is an instruction (defined later) that allows a
	subsequent load or store instruction to perform \texttt{base\_reg +
	index\_reg} indexing.  When an \texttt{index} instruction is found, it
	is considered to be in effect.  Like \texttt{pre} and \texttt{lpre},
	\texttt{index} is inserted automatically by the assembler.

	\texttt{index} can be combined with \texttt{pre} or \texttt{lpre}, and
	it does not matter whether \texttt{index} or the
	\texttt{pre}/\texttt{lpre} instruction came first.

	%\texttt{pre} and \texttt{lpre} cannot both be combined in the same
	%instruction.  If this is attempted, the hardware will treat the
	%instruction as a NOP, and \texttt{pre}, \texttt{lpre}, and
	%\texttt{index} will all stop being in effect.

	%Two \texttt{pre} or \texttt{lpre} instructions also cannot both be
	%combined.  If this is attempted, the hardware will treat the
	%instruction as a NOP, and \texttt{pre}, \texttt{lpre}, and
	%\texttt{index} will all stop being in effect.

	When \texttt{pre}, \texttt{lpre}, or \texttt{index} is in effect,
	interrupts will not be serviced.

	Pseudo code for handling the how \texttt{pre}, \texttt{lpre}, and
	\texttt{index} are to be handled regarding whether or not they are "in
	effect" is as follows:

		\end{itemize}
		\item Opcode \texttt{0x9}:

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Effect:  pushes \texttt{rA} onto the stack, using
			\texttt{rC} as the stack pointer, post-decrementing

			\texttt{rC} as the stack pointer, post-decrementing
			\texttt{rC}.
			\item Note that \texttt{sA} is considered to be 32-bit for the

			treated as a NOP, and \texttt{index} will stop being in effect.
			\item Note:  \texttt{pre} and \texttt{index} can be combined
			with one another (though this is only useful for \texttt{ldr}
			and \texttt{str}).
			\item Note:  A non-\texttt{pre} instruction following
			\texttt{index} will store that that \texttt{index} is not in

			in effect any more).

			instruction cannot be interrupted.
