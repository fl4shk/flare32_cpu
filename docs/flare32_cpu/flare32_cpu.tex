	\setcounter{section}{-1}
	%This is an instruction set designed to be similar to the SuperFX/GSU,
	%while not being binary compatible, nor even assembly language
	%compatible.  It takes some of the ideas from the GSU and runs with
	%them.
	This is an instruction set that is basically just my answer to THUMB
	(especially original THUMB), with some ideas taken from other places as
	well.  This shows how to get more out of 16-bit instructions than THUMB
	allows.

	\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Registers}
	There are sixteen general-purpose registers:  \texttt{r0}, \texttt{r1},
	\texttt{r2}, \texttt{...}, \texttt{r11}, \texttt{r12}, \texttt{lr},
	\texttt{fp}, \texttt{sp}.  Each register
	is 32 bits long.  For special purpose registers, there are also
	\texttt{pc}, the program counter (which is 32 bits long), and the
	\texttt{flags}.  Also there are the interrupts-related registers:
	\texttt{ids} (the destination to go to upon an interrupt happening),
	\texttt{ira} (the program counter value to return to after an
	interrupt) and \texttt{ie} (whether or not interrupts are enabled).
	Two more registers are \texttt{hi} and \texttt{lo}, which are used as
	the high 32 bits and low 32 bits of the result of a 32 by 32 -> 64
	multiplication, or as the high 32 bits and low 32 bits of the result of
	a 64 by 32 -> 64 division.  Here are the flags:

	\section{Instruction Set}
	While this machine takes inspiration from the GSU, it uses 16-bit
	instructions rather than 8-bit ones.

	\subsection{Instruction Group 0:  The \texttt{pre} Instruction}
	The following encoding is used, with each character representing one
	bit:  \\
	\texttt{000i iiii iiii iiii}, where 
	
	\singlespacing
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{i} is a 13-bit constant.
	\end{itemize}

	%At the assembly language level, the instruction is simply
	%\texttt{pre expr}, but it isn't typical to use this instruction
	%directly in assembly language source code.  Instead, when an immediate
	%value will not fit in a 5-bit signed immediate, this instruction will
	%be inserted by the assembler right before the instruction using an
	%immediate value.  The 13-bit constant will be used as bits
	%\texttt{[17:5]} of the immediate value of the following instruction.
	%The full 18-bit immediate value will then be sign extended to 32 bits.
	%Also, if the previous instruction was a \texttt{pre}, interrupts will
	%not be serviced.

	%Multiple \texttt{pre} instructions can be used to form even larger
	%immediates.  If two \texttt{pre} instructions were used, for example, a
	%31-bit immediate can be used.  While not needed in most cases, three
	%\texttt{pre} instructions permit use of 32-bit immediates.
	\texttt{pre} is a mechanism by which immediates larger than 5-bit can
	be used, kind of acting like variable width instructions.
	
	If one \texttt{pre} instruction is used, the immediate field of the
	\texttt{pre} instruction will form bits \texttt{[17:5]} of the
	immediate of the following instruction.  The 18-bit immediate will then
	be sign-extended to 32 bits.

	If two \texttt{pre} instructions are used, the first \texttt{pre}
	instruction forms bits \texttt{[17:5]} of the immediate, and the second
	\texttt{pre} instruction forms bits \texttt{[30:18]} of the immediate.
	The full 31-bit immediate will be sign-extended to 32 bits.

	If three \texttt{pre} instructions are used, the first and second
	\texttt{pre} instructions are treated like when there are only two
	\texttt{pre} instructions, and the final/third \texttt{pre} instruction
	forms just bit \texttt{[31]} of the 32-bit immediate.  In this case, no
	sign extension will be performed.

	%If \texttt{pre} goes into effect, then the first non-\texttt{pre},
	%non-\texttt{index} instruction that is executed while \texttt{pre} is
	%in effect will store that \texttt{pre} is no longer in effect. 

	If a \texttt{pre} instruction is found when there are three
	\texttt{pre} instructions in effect, then the instruction will be
	treated as a NOP.

	Otherwise, if \texttt{pre} is in effect, then the first
	non-\texttt{pre}, non-\texttt{index} instruction that is executed while
	\texttt{pre} is in effect will store that \texttt{pre} is no longer in
	effect.

	If at least one \texttt{pre} is in effect and there is also a
	\texttt{index} in effect, then if the current instruction is
	\texttt{index}, the previous \texttt{pre}(s) and \texttt{index} will
	stop being in effect, and the instruction (which is a second
	\texttt{index}) will be treated as a NOP.

	%If four \texttt{pre} instructions are used, the (effectively 64-bit)
	%instruction will be treated as a \texttt{NOP}.

	%In any of these cases, if \texttt{pre} was the previous instruction,
	%the current instruction cannot be interrupted.
